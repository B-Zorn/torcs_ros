# Parameters used in trajectory generation

f_epsilon_init : 0.5 #"x" distance between terminal points of leftmost and rightmost trajectories of one category   
f_decay_factor : 300 #"y" distance between starting and end point of trajectories 
f_learning_rate : 0.0001 #trajectories generated per category + 1 straight trajectory (total amount = 2*n_amount +1), should be odd (otherwise there is 3 straight trajectories)
a_scanTrack : [3, 6, 11, -7, -4] #all trajectories are published, heavily impacts performance and should only be set to True for debug purposes
